        <h1>Boeing plea deal over fatal Max crashes rejected</h1>
        <p>A Boeing plea deal intended to resolve a case related to two fatal crashes of its planes has been rejected by a US judge.</p>
        <p>The plane maker agreed with the US government in July to plead guilty to one count of criminal fraud, face independent monitoring and pay a $243m (Â£191m) fine.</p>
        <p>However, Judge Reed O'Connor struck down the agreement on Thursday, saying it undermined the court and that diversity requirements for hiring the monitor were "contradictory".</p>
        <p>Family members of the 346 people killed in the crashes welcomed the ruling, describing the plea deal as a "get-out-of-jail-free card for Boeing".</p>
        <p>The Department of Justice said it was reviewing the decision. Boeing did not immediately comment.</p>
        <p>In his decision, Judge O'Connor said the government's previous years of overseeing the firm had "failed".</p>
        <p>"At this point, the public interest requires the court to step in," he wrote.</p>
        <p>He said the proposed agreement did not require Boeing to comply with the monitor's recommendations and gave the company a say in selecting a candidate.</p>
        <p>Those issues had also been raised by some families of those killed on the flights, who had criticised it as a "sweetheart" arrangement that did not properly hold the firm to account for the deaths.</p>
        <p>Judge O'Connor also focused on the deal's requirements that race be considered when hiring the monitor, which he said would undermine confidence in the person hired.</p>
        <p>"In a case of this magnitude, it is in the utmost interest of justice that the public is confident this monitor selection is done based solely on competency," he wrote.</p>
        <p>"The parties' DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] efforts only serve to undermine this confidence in the government and Boeing's ethics and anti-fraud efforts."</p>
